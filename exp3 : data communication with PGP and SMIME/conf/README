First of all, these operations are for Linux's Ubuntu operating system. More specifically, these operations were performed in ubuntu 15.10 operating system. PGP and SMIME's commands are universal for OS but folder structure may be diffrent. Therefore, if you use another operating system, then you must set the appropriate directory for the folders to the operating system you are using. Compatibility with other versions and operating system can not be guaranteed.
